I am starting to learning RUST!And I'm going to use github to record the learning journey.
This project was made while I am reading the book The Rust Programming Language [https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html].
Thanks to the book, I will continue reading this book and create repos.I hope I can enjoy the journey.
In addtion, I just wanna try the `git config user.name` command.
One mooore try.
Finally I made it!The problem is my commit author info couldn't be related to github user info.
The reason is I don't wanna use the email I registered github to commit thus I have to config another
email in github settings-Email first.
